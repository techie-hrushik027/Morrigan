**The Morrigan** is a state-of-the-art editorial and news platform designed for the Indian financial market. Built with a "Security-First" philosophy, it offers in-depth case studies, market analysis, and startup growth journeys, powered by a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI engine.

## 🚀 The Vision & Workflow

**Morrigan** isn't just a blog; it's a "Hardened Intelligence Repository."
1. **Dynamic Content Hub:** Admins manage a real-time feed of market intel with a "Zen-Mode" editor.
2. **State-Gate System:** Blogs are dynamically tagged (`Published`, `Draft`, `Archived`). The public frontend live-syncs with the backend to display only verified intelligence.
3. **The Mind of Morrigan (RAG AI):** We've implemented a custom RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. Using **Pinecone Vector Database** and **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, our chatbot doesn't just "talk"—it "analyzes." It reads the article you are viewing to provide pinpoint accurate financial insights.

## 🛡️ Engineering Excellence (Hardened & Optimized)

We recently completed a **Security & SEO Sprint** to ensure Morrigan is production-ready:
*   **Security:**
    *   **XSS Shield:** Armed with `DOMPurify` to block malicious script injections.
    *   **Auth Vault:** Strictly hashed passwords (PBKDF2) and JWT-protected admin routes (No plain-text fallbacks).
    *   **CORS & DoS:** Whitelisted origin policies and strict payload length validation.
*   **SEO Mastery:**
    *   **Rich Snippets:** Dynamic JSON-LD (BlogPosting) injection for Google Rich Results.
    *   **Automated Sitemap:** Dynamic `sitemap.xml` and `robots.ts` generation via Next.js 15 Metadata API.
